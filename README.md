## Overview

Hey there! 👋 This repository documents my exciting journey into the world of game development using Unity. Coming from a web development background, I decided to explore the possibilities of creating immersive games, and boy, was it an adventure!

## What's Inside?

- **Course Completion**: Completed an amazing Unity game development course, covering everything from the basics to creating a complete video game.

- **Technology Stack**: Transitioned from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to Unity and C#. Explored the creation of a physics sandbox, handling user input, UI, materials, lighting, post-processing effects, and more.

- **Web Integration**: Learned to compile and deploy games to various targets, including WebGL, for a seamless online experience.

- **Feeling the Game Dev Vibes**: Initially thought game dev might be a bit tough for me, but this experience has been eye-opening. It's like discovering a whole new world within the tech space!
